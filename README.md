I enjoyed working on this code along project, using Youtube as a resource, and I learned a ton!
I now understand better:

. how Database (MongoDB in this case) works - importing modules, creating schemas and model, even down to connecting to MongoDB Atlas
. the try ... catch methods and their importance when it comes to responses to requests and errors.
. working with the Express() framework which is a pretty sweet one for building nodejs apps!
. also learned how to use formurl for manipulating data in my database (the express.urlenconded() method)
. the async/await function which is necessary when interacting with databases.
. object destructuring, and many more important concepts and their applications.

Overall, I saw how CRUD makes data manipulation all come together beautifully!

I still have to keep improving but it was beautiful watching this API come to life.
Shoutout to Devtamin.
